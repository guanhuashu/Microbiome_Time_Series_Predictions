# Microbiome_Time_Series_Predictions

Background and motivation 
Longitudinal microbiome data illustrates the dynamic of microbes with hosts and among microbes1. These two types of intersections drive us to first look at differences between host environments regarding the overall trend of microbes over time and secondly dive into how microbial communitiesâ€™ total abundance, absolute abundance by taxonomy level, and relative abundance changes over time by interaction with the host and among different species. One of the major challenges with microbiome data is the small number of samples yet large numbers of microbes at the thousands scale2. According to past literatures, ASVs were grouped at class or order level of the taxonomy3. While class was chosen to compress the feature space in our initial exploratory, we also expect to extend our analysis at a different grouping level. Classes representing < 2% of the total amplicon frequencies were dropped from our analysis. In the subsequent EDA section, we demonstrate how we have found differential aggregated microbiome patterns between host types. We then showcase differential trends across classes of microbes in each host type. Such differential trends then lead us to utilize microbial class relative abundance at each time point to model the microbe-microbe interactions over time.
